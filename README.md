# Analytics Zoo Examples for Cloudera Data Science Workbench

## Overview
This respository includes a number of Analytics Zoo example models. Analytics Zoo makes it easy to build deep learning applications on Spark and BigDL, by providing an end-to-end Analytics + AI Platform. These examples are packaged for Cloudera Data Science Workbench and can be downloaded as a CDSW template.

## What is Analytics Zoo?
Analytics Zoo seamlessly unites Spark, TensorFlow, Keras and BigDL programs into an integrated pipeline; the entire pipeline can then transparently scale out to a large Hadoop/Spark cluster for distributed training or inference.

Analytics Zoo provides several built-in deep learning models that you can use for a variety of problem types such as anomaly detection, object detection, image classification, etc.
